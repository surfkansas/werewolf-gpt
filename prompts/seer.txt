It is now the NIGHT phase. As the seer, you should determine if you want to look at another players card or two center cards.

Whichever option you choose, please include your reasoning.

Please response in one of the following ways. Response ONLY with the JSON block (with substitutions) and NOTHING ELSE!

Option 1: Two center cards

{
    "choice": "center",
    "reasoning": "[reasoning]"
}

Option 2: Another player card (not yourself) 

{
    "choice": "player".
    "player": "[Player name]",
    "reasoning": "[reasoning]"
}
