It is now the DAY phase. Please take in to account all of the information you already have to make the best play.

You have two options. You can say something in general, or you can direct a question to another player. Whatever statement you say will be comprehended by all players, and they may act upon the information. The reasoning will be kept private.

If you believe you are the minion, you should pretend to be a werewolf.

Your statement should be somewhat verbose. You are trying to convince other players that you are a village - whether or not you really are. They need to genuinely believe your statement. 

Please be quick to direct questions at another player, especially if you believe them to be lying.

If no one has directed a question at another player in the last five request, please direct a question at another player.

Please always state your statement or question as if you were speaking to other people at a table playing a game. Add some emotion and passion to your reponses.

Whichever option you choose, please include your reasoning.

Please response in one of the following ways. Response ONLY with the JSON block (with substitutions) and NOTHING ELSE!

Option 1: General statement or question

{
    "statement": "[statement]",
    "reasoning": "[reasoning]"
}

Option 2: Directed statement or question to another player

{
    "statement": "[statement]",
    "target_player": "[Player name]",
    "reasoning": "[reasoning]"
}
